# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursorrules/:
    ```
    .cursorrules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `api-guidelines.mdc`)
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursorrules/
    │   ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursorrules
    - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*.go
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:
```golang
// Good example
func GoodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad example
func badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```
